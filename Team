        <h2> Chloe Ducret </h2>
        <h4> Research collaborator </h4>
        <p> Nurse in the NICU and owner of a Master in nursing. In 2018 she was involved in a research project evaluating readiness to go home in mothers whose infant was hospitalized in the NICU. Mothers were asked if they felt ready to return home and how well they were taught in the hospital, in the days preceding discharge. One month post-discharge, mothers received a phone call asking them if they had had unplanned use of health services in the past month. In this study it has been demonstrated that despite mothers feelt mostly ready to go home after NICU, they still felt unsupported once at home and tended to overuse the health system in an unplanned manner. Main reasons for use of the health system were respiratory and digestive issues in the neonates.</p>
